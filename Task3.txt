1. How is web3 used in componentDidMount? How does the user connect to the blockchain network? This is metamask!
Web3 is used to interact with the user's metamask account and the smart contract that we created.
The user connects to the blockchain network by getting the networkId from the MerchToken.json file,
then creating a web3 contract instance and setting that to the contract property of the window.   


2. pick one function: fetchLoot, addLoot, or buyLoot and explain in detail what it is doing and how
it works. Every line please!

I'll be talking about the buyLoot() function. The first line of the function unpacks the state
variable and extracts the contract and accounts we initialized in the componentDidMount function.
The next line prevents the data passed in from being empty. The third line tells the app that data
is being loaded by setting the loading variable in the state to true. Next, the buyToken method is
accessed from the contract's methods, to which the id of the buyer is sent. Furthermore, the value
and from variables are initialized and implicitly sent to the method as the msg variable. After that
method is done running, the .then() part calls the fetchLoot() method that updates the loot, which
then sets the buying variable to null in the state. Finally, if the method errors, buyLoot() prints
the error message on the console, creates an alert that shows up on the browser of the user, and
sets the buying variable to null in the state.
